# Projects

A collections of mini projects built in Java, JavaScript, Python 

Java


Fibonacci_Sequence

	- Implemented fibonacci sequence by using different algorithms to analyze the time and space complexity
	
	- Learned the strategies to optimize the code by making the program more efficient

GridTraveler
	- Implemented a GridTraveler problem to find how many paths can a traveler travel on a 2D gird; a traveler begins to travel in the top-left corner of a m x n grid, 
	and a traveler's goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. A traveler can only move down or right.
	- Optimize the code by using different techniques of dynamic programming to analyze the time and space complexity.

Multiplication_Recursive

	- Created a method to multiply two numbers by using multiplication recursive. 

Valid_Parentheses

	- Created a program that takes an input string, containing the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid.

Swap_Numbers

	- Implemented methods that swap two numbers without using a temporary varible.

Word_Frequencies

	- Designed a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in an input message. 


JavaScript


zip_unzip_file

	- Created a program that prompts for a user to input a choice to zip or unzip a file, then a user will be asked to enter the path of a file and the path of a target file.


Python


GuessingGame
	
	- Created a guessing number game that allows a user to guess a secret number OR allows a computer guesses a secret number from a user.

Madlibs

	- Built a mad libs game that generates three different stories from a choice of a user by using tkinter. 

Rock_Paper_Scissors

	- Created a rock paper scissors game generator where it allows a user to play the game with computer.

Youtube_Video_Downloader

	- Built a youtube video downloader to download a youtube video. 
	
	- Designed a GUI window with tkinter to prompt for the URL and a path where to save a file, and if a path is not given, it will be downloaded into the default folder.
