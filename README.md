# Projects

A collections of coding challenges implemented in Java, JavaScript, Python 

Java

Check_Permutation

	- Implemented a method to determine if the two input strings are permutation. 

Clock_Angle

	- Wrote a function that returns the acute angle between two hands of a clock.

convertSortedListToBinarySearchTree

	- Implemented a method to convert a sorted singly-linked list to a binary search tree.

Fibonacci_Sequence

	- Implemented fibonacci sequence by using different algorithms to analyze the time and space complexity.
	
	- Learned the strategies to optimize the code by making the program more efficient.

findMostRepeatedWord

	- Created a program that determines the most repeated word in a given string.

	- Designed a method to print out the number of times that the most repeated word appears. 

findVowelsAndConsonants

	- Created a method that takes a string input and prints out the number of vowels and the number of consonants in the given string input, where vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y.

GridTraveler

	- Implemented a GridTraveler problem to find how many paths can a traveler travel on a 2D gird; a traveler begins to travel in the top-left corner of a m x n grid, 
	and a traveler's goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. A traveler can only move down or right.
	
	- Optimized the code by using different techniques of dynamic programming to analyze the time and space complexity.
	
is_Unique

	- Implemented a program to determine if a string has all unique characters.

LinkedLists

	- Implemented a Singly Linked Lists which performs different operations in a singly linked list. For example, retrieve a middle element, add a new node, remove a node, check whether a linked list is a palindrome, and reverse a linked ist. 

Multiplication_Recursive

	- Created a method to multiply two numbers by using multiplication recursive. 

Palindrome_Number

	- Implemented a method to determine if a given number is a palindrome.

String_Permutation

	- Created a method to generate all the strings permutation.

SubstitutionCipher

	- Implemented a substitution cipher to encrypt a message of printable ASCII characters with a random shifting amount(k) in the range of 1-5.

Swap_Numbers

	- Implemented methods that swap two numbers without using a temporary varible.

Valid_Parentheses

	- Created a program that takes an input string, containing the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', and determines if the input string is valid.

Word_Frequencies

	- Designed a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in an input message. 


JavaScript


zip_unzip_file

	- Created a program that prompts for a user to input a choice to zip or unzip a file, then a user will be asked to enter the path of a file and the path of a target file.


Python


GuessingGame
	
	- Created a guessing number game that allows a user to guess a secret number OR allows a computer guesses a secret number from a user.

Madlibs

	- Built a mad libs game that generates three different stories from a choice of a user by using tkinter. 

Rock_Paper_Scissors

	- Created a rock paper scissors game generator where it allows a user to play the game with computer.

Youtube_Video_Downloader

	- Built a youtube video downloader to download a youtube video. 
	
	- Designed a GUI window with tkinter to prompt for the URL and a path where to save a file, and if a path is not given, it will be downloaded into the default folder.
